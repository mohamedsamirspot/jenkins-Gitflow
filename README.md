# jenkins-Gitflow
Here is a simple gitflow to deploy static website on 4 different environemt (dev, test, preprod and prod) from 4 different github branches.
Using minikube kubernates cluster for deployment and jenkins to build the ci/cd multibranch pipeline on some jenkins slave pods.
On each pipeline jenkins file, i build and push docker image from the current branch to dockerhub to a specific dockerhub image with the name of the branch to then run the manifest kubernates deployment file from the slave pod to deploy the app to the required environment.
Thank eng.Karim you for your guidance with us 2looob
